Explanation of the Architecture
1. UserModel (user_model.dart):

Role: This is the data model that represents the user within the system. It is used to map user data between the format stored in Firebase Firestore and the domain entities used within the application.
Functionality: Provides fromMap() and toMap() methods for data serialization and deserialization, allowing data fetched from Firestore to be converted into MyUserModel instances and vice versa.
2. AuthDatasource (auth_datasource.dart):

Role: Functions as the data source layer responsible for interacting directly with Firebase Authentication and Firestore. It is the lowest level of the architecture that deals directly with data fetching and external API communications.
Operations: Includes methods for user authentication tasks such as signing in (with email, Google, Facebook), signing up, logging out, and retrieving current user data.
Interaction with UserModel: Utilizes MyUserModel for creating user instances from Firestore data or preparing data for storage in Firestore, leveraging the fromMap() and toMap() methods.
3. AuthRepo (user_repos.dart):

Role: Serves as the repository layer that abstracts the operations related to user authentication from the domain layer. This component ensures that the domain layer does not need to know about the specifics of data fetching mechanisms or external APIs.
Connection to AuthDatasource: Delegates authentication operations to AuthDatasourceImpl, which performs the actual interactions with Firebase.
Error Handling: Translates exceptions thrown by AuthDatasource into domain-specific Failure objects. This allows the domain layer to handle errors consistently and maintain separation from external data sources.
Data Handling: Receives MyUserModel instances from the AuthDatasource and converts them into domain entities (MyUser), or wraps the results in Either types to signify success or failure.
Connecting the Components
Flow of Data: When the domain layer (e.g., view models or use cases) requests an operation like logging in a user, it interacts only with the AuthRepo interface. This maintains a clean separation of concerns.
From Domain to Data Source:
The request is passed from the domain layer to AuthRepoImpl.
AuthRepoImpl then calls the appropriate method on AuthDatasourceImpl.
Execution by AuthDatasource:
AuthDatasourceImpl executes the operation using Firebase services. It constructs new MyUserModel instances or updates existing ones based on Firestore data interactions.
Any exceptions are caught and processed into ServerException.
Data Transformation and Return:
Results (or exceptions) are sent back from AuthDatasourceImpl to AuthRepoImpl.
AuthRepoImpl transforms these results into either success (Right(MyUser)) or failure (Left(Failure)) states using Either from fpdart.
Back to Domain:
The final processed results are then returned to the domain layer, which only receives clean and straightforward success or error states, completely abstracted from the complexities of the data source implementations.
